## :bar_chart: **Municipal Success Rating of the Restaurant Industry**
This project presents dashboards generated from a model predicting the success of businesses at the national and state levels. The model is based on governmental data from sources like INEGI, DENUE, and GOB, weighting various variables to assign a percentage rating to each municipality. Examples of variables include: TPV transactions per 10,000 adults, number of ATMs, schools, banks, etc. Feature engineering and clustering techniques were used to refine the rating process.
